# 🏆 AI-Powered Resume Screening & Student Ranking System  

This **AI-powered tool** automates the resume screening process by ranking candidates based on their relevance to a given job description. It leverages **NLP and machine learning** to compare resumes using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Automated Resume Parsing** – Extracts text from PDF resumes.  
✅ **AI-Based Ranking** – Uses **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity** to rank candidates.  
✅ **Customizable** – Allows users to input job descriptions and upload resumes.  
✅ **Interactive UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for easy access.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **NLP (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)**  
- **Scikit-Learn**  
- **PyPDF2** (for extracting text from PDFs)  
- **Pandas**  
- **Streamlit** (for the user interface)  

## 📌 How It Works  
1. **Enter the job description** in the text area.  
2. **Upload multiple PDF resumes** using the file uploader.  
3. The system **extracts text** from resumes and ranks them based on similarity to the job description.  
4. **View the ranked results** in a structured table.
